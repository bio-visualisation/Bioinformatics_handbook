- In this section of the book, I shall introduce you to the concept of circular RNA and its identification from RNA-Seq data.

- Circular RNAs are product of back-splicing event where it forms a covalently closed circular structure of RNA.

- These class of RNA does not have 5' cap or 3' poly-A-tail.

- To identify the circular RNA from RNA-Seq data, several algorithms have been developed that mostly detect the back-splice junction (BSJ) region.

- Here, I shall introduce you with two identification tools i.e., [CIRIquant](https://github.com/bioinfo-biols/CIRIquant) and [CIRCexplorer3](https://github.com/YangLab/CLEAR).
