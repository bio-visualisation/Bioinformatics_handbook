# Conda environment

## Introduction

- conda is a package manager where users can easily find and install thousands of packages.

- It is also an environment manager which can create a separate environment within a few seconds which runs on different dependencies.

- It is compatible with multiple OS. 

- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers){target="_blank"} (minimal version of conda) can be downloaded as a script file (.sh) from the given link and installed using the following command.

- Download Miniconda (file size ~ 2.36 Mb)
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Install Miniconda
```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- This means every time you open your terminal, it will initialize conda by default.

- Type yes. If you wish to reverse it later, you can do it.

- The Miniconda installation process is complete. Close the terminal and open again.

- (base) at the command prompt indicate conda base environment is active.

- For basic conda commands, you can follow this link. [Conda commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html){target="_blank"} 

- This installation process would create a directory called miniconda3 which would have all the installed packages as well as the environment dependencies.

:::{.callout-warning}
Please do not delete 'miniconda3' directory.
Deleting this directory would remove conda environment.

## Create a conda environment with required packages

- Here I want to create a conda environment with all packages required for RNA-Seq analysis. The details of the packages will be discussed in the next section.

- ENV Name - rnaSeq

- Packages: fastqc, trim-galore, star, subread, multiqc

- Packages to be installed from bioconda channel.

```bash
conda create --name rnaSeq -c bioconda fastqc trim-galore star subread multiqc
```

- The process may take several minutes depending on the network speed.

```bash
#List conda environments
conda env list
```

- To activate our desired environment, run the following command.

```bash
conda activate rnaSeq
```

- Check whether our desired packages are installed or not. For example check trim-galore.

```bash
conda list | grep trim-galore
```

- In the next section, we shall discuss about using remote HPC server.
